As stated above, ASINs themselves are not specific to a seller.

However, if you go to a seller’s storefront page within Amazon, then look at one of their items, the URL is modified to filter only on that particular seller’s offer.
In this way you can get a URL for an ASIN that always shows only your offer.

Storefront URL:
https://www.amazon.com/s?marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER&merchant=SellerId27
*replace ‘SellerId’ with your SellerId
*ATVPDKIKX0DER = US marketplace, you will also need to change this value if you wish to view a storefront in another marketplace or region.

Seller specific ASIN URL:
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/ASIN?m=SellerID34
*replace ‘ASIN’ with your ASIN, and ‘SellerID’ with your SellerId

Example:
http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00125Q75Y42
This product has multiple variations and dozens of sellers with available offers.

But if you filter it through the lens of one specific seller’s storefront, you now see only that seller’s offer.
